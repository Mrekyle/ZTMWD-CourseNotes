	<p>The best way to use git is to have keep the master branch as the one that is viewable to the public, the final product that you want everyone to see! And then create branches that each individual team member works of and commits too. Then once its been reviewd and tested and approved by all members, bring it back into the master branch by merging. To get it to show the branch directory use this code - <br>
