		Hellloooo There. - this is an example of text that the browser doesnt know what to do with, so it just puts it on the page with no real thought.<hr>

		<h1>Hello World</h1>
		<h3>Hello World</h3>
		<h6>Hello world</h6>
		<p>Header tags, like abouve are used for making section/paragraph headers like in writing, it goes from 1-6 each time slightly adjusting the outcome, Above is 1, 3, 6</p><hr>


		<p>TO get filler text 'lorem' type the word and press tab </p>
		<p>To make words bold/italic you use the <strong>'strong'</strong> or <em>'em'</em> tags around the desired word, also in the below paragraph.</p>
		<p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod
		tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam,
		quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo
		<strong>consequat</strong>. Duis aute irure dolor in <em>reprehenderit</em> in voluptate velit esse
		cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur. Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non
		proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum.</p><hr>
 
 		<p>Below are a selection of different lists, an Un ordered list 'ul', which uses bullet points for the list items. An Ordered list 'ol' which uses numbers for the list items. And a Nested list, which can use either either list type in the list itself, to create a 'sublist'. In each list you have List Items' which are the items that appear in the list itself. </p>

		<ul>
			<li>Apples</li>
			<li>Oranges</li>
			<li>Peach</li>
		</ul>

		<ol>
			<li>Apples</li>
			<li>Oranges</li>
			<li>Peach</li>
		</ol>

		<ul>
			<li>Apples</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Fuji</li>
					<li>Pink Lady</li>
					<li>Granny Smith</li>
				</ul>
			<li>Oranges</li>
			<li>Peach</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Below is an image, for that we use the 'img' tag, which looks a little something like this,<br>'img src="smiley.gif" alt="Smiley" height="42px" width="42px<br>
			<img src="https://www.specialtyproduce.com/sppics/914.png" alt="Fuji Apples" height="70px" width="70px"><br>
		Each part of the code does something different, to explain ill use a list.</p>

		<ol>
			<li>'img' - To tell the web page that there should be an image shown here</li>
			<li>'src=""' - To tell the web page where the image you wanted to show is located</li>
			<li>'alt' - Is telling the web page the name of the image, So for when a screen reader reads the page, it recognizes that the picture is called 'Fuji Apple'.</li>
			<li>'height' 'width' - Is telling the page the size that the image should be</li>
		</ol>

		<p>When having a large body of text with no CSS styling it can be difficult to put writing on a new line or seperate certain text, thats where the Line Break tag comes in 'br' which breaks the line of text. Which is what I did above, to place the example code on a new line. There is also the 'hr' tag, which creates a horizontal line across the web page. Which ill insert below. <hr> Now both of these tags are called 'Self Closing Tags' which means they do not need to be closed by doing '/hr' '/br'.</p>


		<p>The Anchor tag 'a' is telling the web page that there is a clickable link to send you to a new page on the website, or an external page, such as social media. Included in the 'a' tag there must be the attribute 'href' which tells the web page where to send you once it has been clicked. </p>
		age.html"'.</p><hr>

		<h1>QUESTION TIME!</h1>

		<p>In the course there was a question that asked - Why index.html for the page name?<br></p>
		<p>And the answer is because that servers are automatically configured to send the page called 'index.html' when requested for a web page, now this can also be changed to what ever you want the first page to be, but it has to be configured on the server side configuration.</p><hr>


		<p>When multiple developers are working on the same page of code, they may want to leave notes for others in the team, so they know whrre to go/how something works, and they can do that by '!-- Here is an example --' After this text I will add a comment, which will only show up to  me (the developer) and not on the public page.</p>
		<!-- Here is an Example of a comment for another developer --><hr>

		<p>'div' '/div' tags are basically useless in just html, they are used to divide up the content on the page, also known as a block tag, such as wrapping paragraphs in a divider or a form. When not using CSS it is useless to do, as it is used to make stying the content easier</p>

		<p>'span' '/span' tags are also basically useless in just html, they are used to add styling to certain lines of code, as they are an inline element.</p>

		<p>These are both used for either styling or specific funtions to the selected lines/blocks of code.</p>

		<p>Ctirical Render path, is the path that the computer takes over the internet to get all the nescecery files for your website to show how its inteded.</p><hr>

		<p>Meta tags are a basic way for the website to read important information about the website, such as keywords to help with search engine results, how it should work on a mobile phone, who the author is, the description of the website.. etc, Find out more <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_meta.asp">Here</a></p><hr>

		<p>Media queries, allow you to tell the website how to read the css files on certain screen sizes/devices! Done in css by @media</p>
		<hr><br>

		<p>For Navigation, it is best practice to have it as un unordered list, with no list styling, usgin flex box, and a push class, so it is possible to have extra information pushed all the way to one side,</p><hr>

		<p>When linking a Javascript file, simply do exactly the same as a normal link, Just put it inside the 'script' tag and use 'src' to tell it where to go. For multiple scripts, Just add multiple 'script' tags. This must be placed at the bottom of the html file! Due to the way the browser reads the files.</p><hr>

		<h1>STATE</h1>
      	<p>Simply means the description that describes your app. Its an object that desribes the state of your app. Meaning you are able to change the state of what ever inputs are received. Such as in the robo friends lessons search box. We are changing the state of the app, depending on what inputs are received. STATE ---(Feeds) props - The child component can never change the propertie that was defined.</p><hr>

      	<h1>PROPS</h1>
      	<p>Props are always just inputs that are given in the code and never change, meaning we will always know what they look like!</p>

      	<h1>HTTP - Hyper Text Transfer Protocol/Secure</h1>
      	<ul>
      		<li>Get - Means I want to get the hmtl file from the server, Server responds with a http message, and the html file</li>
      		<li>post - I want to send you something to add to the servers or database</li>
      		<li>push - Im going to ssned some data, and I want you to update the preexisting data that already exists</li>
      		<li>delete - Means delete on the servers or database</li>
      	</ul>

      	<p>GET - means it sends the information through a query string - this returns querey string paramaters</p>
      	<p>Query sting, means the information being posted to the servers is attatched to the url</p>
      	<p>POST - means it send the information through the body - This will return form data </p>
      	<p>HTTPS - Makes the data encrypted, so that only the server and client know how to read the message</p><hr>

      	<h1>JSON</h1>
      	<p>Javascript object notation</p>
      	<p>JSON is a syntax for storing and exchanging data, JSON Is text written with Javascrpit object notation. This can be read by any language, and then converted to any other language </p>

      	<h1>AJAX</h1>
      	<p>Basically as soon as anything happens, it asks the server for the specific data thats needed in response, without refreshing the whole web page, Such as on google, when typing into the search bar, you get suggestions of different items! That is AJAX! In the react APP we used 'fetch' This is the new way of doing AJAX requests</p>


<script type="text/javascript">
	var  toDo = [
	"Clean Room",
	"Eat Healthy",
	"Go for a run",

	"Build desk"

var toDoLength = toDo.length;
for (var i=0; i < toDoLength; i++) {
	console.log(i);

toDo.forEach(function(toDo, i) {
	console.log(toDo, i)
})
